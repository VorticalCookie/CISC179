Description:
Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to have a higher hand value than the dealer without going over 21. 

Blackjack Rules:
 * Players receive all cards face up and the dealer’s first card is face up and the second is face down.
 * When you receive your first two cards, you may either “stand” or “hit.” When you “stand” it means you feel you are close enough to 21 and no longer wish any additional cards.
 * If you wish to receive another card you need to “hit” . You may draw as many cards as you want until you are close to 21 or until you “bust.”
 * If a hand goes over 21, it is called a “bust” or “break” and the wager is lost.
 * If the dealer’s hand “busts” or “breaks,” you win as well.
 * If you are closer to 21 than the dealer, you win. But If the dealer is closer to 21 then the dealer wins.
 * If your initial two cards total 21, any Ace with a 10, Jack, Queen, or King, you have a Blackjack and automatically win.
 * In Blackjack, Jacks, Queens, Kings and 10s count as 10. An Ace may be played as a one or an 11. All other cards are played at face value.
